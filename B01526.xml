            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>YOUR Joy (grave <hi>Citizens</hi>) is Ours, we find;</l>
               <l>This Choyce to <hi>You,</hi> This Choyce to <hi>Vs</hi> proves Kind!</l>
               <l>We give Commiſſion, that Our Thanks ſhould wait on</l>
               <l>The Kind Electors of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Sir <hi>Thomas Player, Pilkington,</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thus We Our Joy, by This Return do prove.</l>
               <l>For to throw <hi>Papiſts</hi> out, is all Your Aim;</l>
               <l>Your Thoughts are Ours, they are the very ſame:</l>
               <l>You Burn the <hi>Pope,</hi> We come to ſee him Burn'd;</l>
               <l>Our Wrath, like Yours, againſt his Tribe is turn'd.</l>
               <l>We hate a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt</hi> We hate;</l>
               <l>We cou'd Crack <hi>Muſſle</hi>-Shells upon his Pate:</l>
               <l>We hate the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and ev'ry thing like that;</l>
               <l>Had I but time (Sirs,) I wou'd tell You what.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>But now I'le tell You, We do Love all thoſe,</l>
                  <l>That are Abhorrers of a <hi>Roman</hi> Noſe;</l>
                  <l>And ſuch, laſt <hi>Fryday,</hi> it appears You Choſe.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>We <hi>Thank</hi> you for Your Choice; This is the way</l>
               <l>To pack both <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Devil</hi> quite away.</l>
               <l>They gain no Ground, where ſuch Men do appear:</l>
               <l>They do no <hi>Bulls</hi> from <hi>Roman</hi> Empires fear.</l>
               <l>Such Men, We do believe, they are, as ſtand</l>
               <l>Zealouſly for the Int'reſt of our Land.</l>
               <l>Their Courage, Wit, and Parts have all been Try'd;</l>
               <l>I'me ſure, they <hi>Four</hi> wou'd have been Deify'd,</l>
               <l>Had they done half ſo much for th' <hi>Roman</hi> Crew,</l>
               <l>As They have done for Us, and done for You.</l>
               <l>Wiſely they did Behave themſelves, we find;</l>
               <l>All of one Way, all of one Heart, and Mind.</l>
               <l>They ſhook off Fear, and trampl'd upon Awe;</l>
               <l>On Their Side ſtood the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Law.</hi>

This made them Bold as <hi>Lyons;</hi> every Man,</l>
               <l>Through Thorns and Bryars, for the <hi>City</hi> ran!</l>
               <l>Mildly, and Modeſtly, they play'd their Parts:</l>
               <l>I do not wonder, that They won Your Hearts.</l>
               <l>Had You Elected others in their ſteed,</l>
               <l>Surely you'd done a very Evil Deed:</l>
               <l>For, Who cou'd equalize the Parts and Care</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Clayton, Pilkington,</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Player?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Your Choyce was like You, Grave, Diſcreet, and Wiſe;</l>
               <l>That all Men ſee, that have not <hi>Popiſh</hi> Eyes.</l>
               <l>And We, with all Our Hearts, do now Rejoyce,</l>
               <l>That You have made ſo Good, ſo Bleſs'd a Choyce.</l>
               <l>I know that ſome Men's Hearts, for Grief, do Bleed,</l>
               <l>That You ſo ſoon, that You ſo well Agreed.</l>
               <l>But who are they? Why? They are Imps of Hell,</l>
               <l>Who when you Act like Angels, think not well.</l>
               <l>They are the Spawn of a devouring <hi>Pope,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That Merit nothing better than a Rope.</l>
               <l>The Seed of Evil Doers, who dayly ſtrive</l>
               <l>To keep the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Alive;</l>
               <l>Men void of Grace, Wit, Honeſty, and Senſe,</l>
               <l>Who itch to pay the <hi>Pope</hi> his <hi>Peter-pence.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Theſe Men are they, who are not pleas'd to ſee,</l>
               <l>That you ſo well, in your good Choice agree.</l>
               <l>Such we have too too many here (<hi>God</hi> knows)</l>
               <l>Who long for nothing more than Blood and Blows:</l>
               <l>I wiſh they had them, were they but Deſtroyed,</l>
               <l>Then Peace and Plenty would be ſoon enjoy'd.</l>
               <l>The time may come, the time I hope to ſee,</l>
               <l>That <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> may well agree:</l>
               <l>Then have at ſuch uneaſy Knaves as thoſe,</l>
               <l>Who long have been the <hi>King,</hi> and Kingdoms Foes.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>God</hi> give the <hi>King</hi> to ſee thoſe Miſchief-makers,</l>
               <l>That they of <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Fate may be Partakers.</l>
               <l>Then will the City Flouriſh, Suburbs Sing</l>
               <l>Praiſes to <hi>God,</hi> and Thanks unto our <hi>King.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Oh! How I long methinks to ſee that day,</l>
               <l>When <hi>Papiſts</hi> pack their Awls to go away;</l>
               <l>May every City do as you have done;</l>
               <l>This is one way I'me ſure to make them Run.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>May ev'ry County chuſe ſuch Worthy Men,</l>
                  <l>Chuſe them, and Chuſe, Chuſe them yet agen;</l>
